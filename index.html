        "Wobbly" is one of the terms used to describe felines who were born with Cerebellar Hypoplasia which we'll be talking about
        here; that's quite a mouthful so many people say "CH Cats" or more simply -and accurately- angel kitties!

        My name is <a href="mailto=JaynieKitttyWeb@gmail.com "> Jayne </a> and I would like to tell you a little about feline
        Cerebellar Hypoplasia, since I have a mild case of it myself. Though <a href="mailto=Cailin@thewebkitty.com "> Mother </a>is
        helping me with typing and coding -my paws don't seem to agree with this keyboard- it was my idea to make a special
        page for you to learn about these special kitties. I hope you like this site.

        <h3>What is Cerebellar Hypoplasia?</h3>
    </div>

      });
    </script>
    <p>Cerebellar Hypoplasia refers to the condition of having a brain that is underdeveloped, particularly in areas of the
        cerebellum where fine motor control is located. It's present when a kitten is born and it isn't contagious. CH has
        a range of causes and also occurs in humans and canines; although there can be genetic factors involved, CH kitties
        aren't "bred ".
        <br> Those with the condition are <span><b>not </b> suffering and we usually don't view ourselves as having any abnormalities and are, in fact, known to be extremely intelligent and independent.
            </span></p>

    <p>The most common difference about us that people notice is <i> our walk</i>. Mild to moderate CH cats are often described
        as having the swagger of an intoxicated sailor. </p>

        <h3>Is a Wobbly in Your Future?</h3>
    </div>
    <br>Special Considerations</br>
    </h3>


    <ul>

        <li>Litter Box </li>
        - Many cats with CH have a bit of trouble in this area. Once you get to know your pet you'll see what, if any, accommodations
        need to be made. We know where "to go " but accidents can happen so it's best if you have a plan for this scenario.


        <li>Other Pets</li>
        - We need a peaceful home and don't like rambunctious distractions;safety is of utmost importance! (Personally, I don't mind
        a little horse <i>play</i> with my brother and sister and I let them know when I've had enough.
        <br>-This evaluation goes the same if you have children in your home. It's harder for us to get away when picked
        up against our will. Although we are adorable, we are not toys and our lives are as precious as those of any other
        family member.


        <li>Time</li>
        -We can be left alone happily for long stretches but at first we need you to get to know us as we need to become familiar
        with you. As you get to know us, you'll know our individual needs for time together or how often we need to be "checked
        on ".
